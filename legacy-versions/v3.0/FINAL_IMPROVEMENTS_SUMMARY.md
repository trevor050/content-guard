## üîß Specific Pattern Improvements

### Power Dynamics Harassment
```javascript
// Before: /i can make (your life|things) (difficult|hell)/i
// After: /i can make (your life|things).*(difficult|hell)/i
```
- **Fixed**: "I can make your life very difficult" now detected
- **Added**: 8 new power dynamic patterns from benchmark failures

### Social Exclusion Detection
```javascript
// Added comprehensive workplace isolation patterns:
/nobody on the team.*wants to work with you/i,
/everyone'?s been talking about.*(behind your back|attitude problems)/i,
/you don'?t really fit in with.*group dynamic/i
```

### Technical Context Protection
```javascript
// Enhanced technical phrase detection:
['kill process', 'kill task', 'kill command', 'process', 'server', 'system', 'container', 'docker']
```

### Business Context Protection
```javascript
// Added competitive analysis terms:
['killing us', 'killing it', 'market share', 'competition', 'competitor', 'performance']
```
