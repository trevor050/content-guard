const tieredGuard = new TieredContentGuard({
  enableTier3: false  // User opt-out of expensive analysis
})

const result = await tieredGuard.analyze(content)
// Automatically escalates through tiers based on uncertainty
```

```javascript
const tieredGuard = new TieredContentGuard({
  tier1: { spamThreshold: 6 },
  tier2: { spamThreshold: 3.5 },
  tier3: { spamThreshold: 2.5, enableMLFeatures: true },
